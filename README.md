## [Project Wiki](https://github.com/jordankettles/345-group-project/wiki/)
We are building an AI generated poetry app using a custom trained AI model to produce poems based on short prompts. Users can then pick a new prompt from the generated poem or suggest a different prompt altogether. This app will allow users to find inspiration when stuck in a creative block.

## Alpha
Our Alpha build uses Hugging Face's GPT-2 Model under Apache 2.0 License. For our release build, we want to train our own model using a range of different poems. But for now, because this current model is not trained for poems please take the output with a grain of salt, as we did not train this model ourselves. It contains inherent bias that we do not intend our final model to have, so some of the output may be incoherent or vulgar.

### Building the Alpha
To build the Alpha, Sync the Project with Gradle Files then Build the Project in Android Studio.

Android Studio needs to sync to download the GPT-2 model, which cannot be uploaded to GitHub
because of their 100MB file size limit. The model is 236MB.
