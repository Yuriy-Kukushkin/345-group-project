### [Project Wiki](https://github.com/jordankettles/345-group-project/wiki/)
We are going to build an AI generated poetry app using a custom trained AI model to produce poems based on short prompts as little as a single word or phrase. Users can then pick a new prompt from the generated poem or suggest a different prompt altogether. This app will allow users to find inspiration when stuck in a creative block.

The app aims to be interactive enough to be engaging, but to not require so much input from the user to be cumbersome. When using the app, users should feel free to allow their mind to wander and explore new ideas. 

### Artificial Intelligence
The AI will be based on GPT-2, custom trained to generate poetry specifically. The model will be converted to a Tensorflow Lite model for use on Android.

- Testing Android App Integration -- This will need to be completed early on to assess the feasibility of running the AI on mobile hardware. 

- AI Design -- The team will specify the expected inputs and outputs of the AI and the training samples that it will need. 

- Data Collection -- A massive sample of poetry data will be required to produce convincing AI. This data must be found, formatted, and sorted for training. 

### Secondary Goals
App Widget - A widget that serves poems to place on the homescreen. 

Social Media Integration - Allows users to share their poems and prompts.
